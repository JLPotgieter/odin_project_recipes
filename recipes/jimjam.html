    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A jam with Jimi or a 'JimJam', as it is known colloquially, is any form of creative activity engaged in under the auspices of Jimi.
        Jamming with Jimi is generally productive, yet relaxing. But one must make the most of it for as long as it's there, 
        as there typically won't be a follow up, Jimi being a rather mercurial creature.
